# IPL resource for FiveM

### Credits
_Let's get this straight right away, many thanks to the authors of the releases mentioned below for their resources!_

Original IPL list used from [Mikeeh's release](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-load-unloaded-ipls/5911?source_topic_id=25240), also used some IPLs from the updated list from [Bob_74's release](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-fix-holes-in-the-map/25240).
DLC (Smugglers Run and Doomsday) interiors and interior-props list used from [Smallo's release](https://forum.fivem.net/t/dev-doomsday-smugglers-run-interiors-props-ipls-teleport/92124?u=vespura) although some stuff has been changed.

All code in this project is done by myself. Just the interior (-props) lists and the files in the stream folder have been copied from the resources mentioned in the credits above.
